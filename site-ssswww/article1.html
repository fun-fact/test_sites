            <p>[One of the first questions every aspiring entrepreneur will ask themselves is: “When will I be ready to turn my passion projects into a startup?” Trying out your business as a side hustle can be smart because it minimizes the risks of testing product-market fit and finding your first customers.
But once you’ve built a proof of concept and generated some revenue, it might be time to quit the day job and dedicate yourself full time to your venture.
For David Khim, co-founder of content marketing agency Omniscient Digital, the decision to launch his business in June 2022 was made even more difficult due to market conditions.
“This appeared to be a risky time to jump in full time because we focus on services for B2B software companies, which were getting hit hard by the market and seeing layoffs across the board. We wondered if clients would cut us as part of the cost-cutting exercise. We wondered if these software companies would still be open to investing in working with agencies,” says Khim.
“We wonder if we’d be able to get a business loan if we were in trouble. We wondered if the business didn’t work, would we be able to get new jobs?”
But the founders had already built the business on the side for three years, and therefore were confident in their company’s ability to get clients, service them, and maintain a healthy net profit margin.
A tip for handling this transition: Before you jump ship, have a solid business plan in place. There are plenty of business plan templates online that you can borrow, but think critically about your financial performance and exit plan.
Use the revenue figures from your side hustle, and model financial projections to see if it’s feasible to take your company full time. And while it might sound pessimistic, consider what you’ll do if your startup goes bust. Baking in an exit strategy with performance indicators and a timeline will prepare you for the worst-case scenario.
Hiring your first employee
Depending on your business model, hiring your first employee can come with a variety of risks. First, there are the preventable risks of making sure you follow the mandatory hiring process to comply with the law.
More important, there are strategic and external risks involved. From the strategic angle, you’re taking on the responsibility for your employees’ livelihood, and adding to your business expenses. Ensure your business is set up to sustain employment by taking a critical look at its financial performance and operations.
And try as you might to hire the right person for the job, you still bear the external risks that the candidate simply isn’t a match in the long run.
However, the risks can result in rich payoffs. Take Beth Kennedy, founder of marketing agency SATT.co. By August 2021, she knew it was time to leave her job and pursue freelancing full time. In her first five months, she quickly went from having one client to five clients. Her life was consumed with work.
“I originally left my 9-to-5 for more freedom, and somehow I traded the 9-to-5 for a 24/7 work life. It was time to hire my first full-time employee. That’s when it all felt real: ‘What if this all disappears tomorrow? How can I be responsible for another person?’” says Kennedy.
She evaluated the risk of hiring her first employee and knew that her business had enough funds in the bank to cover an employee’s salary for five months — then took the leap.
